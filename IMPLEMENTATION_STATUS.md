# Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29

This document provides an honest assessment of what has been implemented and tested.

## What Works

### Core Translation (Tested)

**Parser**
- Parses basic Cypher queries (MATCH, WHERE, RETURN)
- Creates AST for query structure
- Tests: 64 tests, 61 passing (95%)
- Coverage: 85%

**Translator**
- Translates MATCH → graph-match
- Translates WHERE → KQL where clauses
- Translates RETURN → project clauses
- Tests: 35 integration tests, all passing
- Coverage: 64-83% on core modules

**Schema Mapper**
- Loads YAML schema configurations
- Maps Cypher labels to Sentinel tables
- 20+ predefined node/edge mappings
- Tests: 54 tests
- Coverage: 78-97%

### Query Optimization (Implemented)

**Optimizer**
- 5 optimization rules implemented
- Cost-based query planning
- Tests: 53 tests, 52 passing (98%)
- Coverage: 84-92%

### Infrastructure (Configured)

**CI/CD**
- GitHub Actions workflow configured
- Linting (black, ruff, mypy)
- Test execution with coverage reporting

**Deployment**
- Docker and docker-compose configuration
- Kubernetes manifests
- Azure Bicep templates for infrastructure

## What Needs Work

### Not Tested Against Azure Sentinel

**Current State**:
- Integration test infrastructure created (tests/sentinel_integration/)
- Can create workspaces and ingest data
- **Not yet executed** due to:
  - Requires Azure subscription with permissions
  - Requires authentication setup
  - Incurs Azure costs (~$0.10-1.00 per test run)

**Next Steps**:
- Authenticate with `az login`
- Configure subscription ID and resource group
- Run `./tests/sentinel_integration/run_integration_tests.sh`

### Persistence Layer

**Current State**:
- PostgreSQL configured in docker-compose
- Database schema defined in init-db.sql
- GraphManager still uses in-memory storage

**Needs**:
- Implement database backend (db_backend.py)
- Replace in-memory dicts with database queries
- Test persistence across restarts

### AI Translation

**Current State**:
- Anthropic API integration implemented
- Query classifier and pattern cache implemented
- **Not tested with actual API** due to:
  - Requires CLAUDE_API_KEY
  - Incurs API costs

**Defaults**:
- Falls back to direct translation if no API key
- Mock mode available for testing

### Advanced Features

**Not Yet Implemented**:
- Complex multi-hop query optimization
- Persistent graph snapshots (in-memory only currently)
- Advanced path algorithms (shortest path structure exists but needs testing)
- Load testing validation

## Test Coverage Summary

| Module | Tests | Status | Coverage |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Parser | 64 | 95% passing | 85% |
| Translator | 35 | 100% passing | 64-83% |
| Schema | 54 | Unknown | 78-97% |
| Optimizer | 53 | 98% passing | 84-92% |
| Algorithms | 71 | Unknown | 93% |
| Security | 37 | Unknown | - |
| Monitoring | 59 | 98% passing | - |
| Load Testing | 38 | 87% passing | 88-95% |

**Total**: 411+ tests written, ~300 tests verified passing

---

## Known Limitations

1. **No validation against actual Sentinel** - Tests use local parser/translator only
2. **Persistent graph uses memory** - Database backend not connected
3. **AI translation not tested** - Would require API key and costs
4. **Schema mappings are generic** - May need tuning for specific Sentinel deployments
5. **Performance claims unverified** - Benchmarks run locally without actual Sentinel
6. **Security features untested** - Authorization and audit logging need integration testing

---

## Required for Azure Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with Log Analytics workspace creation permissions
- Microsoft Sentinel enabled on workspace
- CLAUDE_API_KEY environment variable (for AI-enhanced translation)
- PostgreSQL database accessible (or use docker-compose)

### Cost Estimates
- Log Analytics workspace: ~$2-5/GB ingested
- Query execution: Included with workspace
- Data retention: ~$0.10/GB/month
- Sentinel: Additional charges for analytics rules

### Environment Variables Needed
```
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<your-subscription-id>
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=Yellowstone
SENTINEL_WORKSPACE_ID=<workspace-guid>
CLAUDE_API_KEY=<your-api-key> (optional)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

## Next Steps for Validation

1. **Azure Authentication**
   ```bash
   az login
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```

2. **Run Sentinel Integration Tests**
   ```bash
   cd tests/sentinel_integration
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your Azure details
   ./run_integration_tests.sh
   ```

3. **Connect Database**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d postgres
   # Update GraphManager to use database backend
   ```

4. **Run Full Test Suite**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/ --cov=src/yellowstone
   ```

## Honest Assessment

**What We Have**:
- Working Cypher parser and KQL translator
- Comprehensive test infrastructure
- Deployment configurations
- ~30,000 lines of code

**What We Don't Have**:
- Validation against actual Azure Sentinel
- Database-backed persistence
- Validated performance claims
- Tested security controls

**Recommendation**: Run integration tests against Azure Sentinel before considering for any deployment.
