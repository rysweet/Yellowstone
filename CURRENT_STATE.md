# Project Yellowstone - Current State

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: Core translation functional, validated against Azure Sentinel

## What This Is

A Cypher-to-KQL translator for Microsoft Sentinel. Converts Cypher graph queries into KQL queries using Kusto's `make-graph` operator.

## Modules (6 Essential)

1. **parser/** - Cypher → AST (working)
2. **translator/** - AST → KQL components (working)
3. **main_translator.py** - Orchestration (working)
4. **schema/** - Label → Table mapping (working)
5. **security/** - Authorization, injection prevention (implemented, not tested)
6. **ai_translator/** - Complex query handling via Anthropic (implemented, requires API key)

## What Was Removed (74% of code)

- persistent_graph/ (2,100 lines) - Misunderstood make-graph as persistent
- optimizer/ (1,955 lines) - Unused by translator
- algorithms/ (800 lines) - KQL has these natively
- load_testing/ (700 lines) - Testing wrong thing
- monitoring/ (800 lines) - Over-engineered
- benchmarks/ (700 lines) - Testing query execution not translation
- 23 point-in-time report files

**Total removed**: ~23,000 lines

## Current Capabilities (Validated)

**Parser**:
- MATCH (nodes, relationships, properties) ✓
- WHERE (comparisons, AND/OR/NOT) ✓
- RETURN (properties, aliases, ORDER BY, LIMIT) ✓
- Property access (n.name, n.age) ✓

**Translator**:
- Generates complete KQL with make-graph ✓
- Correct Sentinel table mapping ✓
- All query clauses ✓
- Executable output ✓

**Validation**:
- 35/35 integration tests passing ✓
- Tested against Azure Sentinel ✓
- Cost: $0.60 in Azure charges ✓

## What Doesn't Work Yet

- Multi-hop queries (implementation exists but not tested)
- Variable-length paths (implementation incomplete)
- Complex aggregations
- AI translation (requires CLAUDE_API_KEY)

## Code Size

- **Files**: 49 Python files
- **Lines**: 8,078 (down from 31,000)
- **Focus**: Translation only
- **No BS**: No mocks, no stubs, no TODO comments in critical paths

## Next Steps

1. Test multi-hop queries against Sentinel
2. Complete variable-length path implementation
3. Validate AI translation with Anthropic API
4. Add more schema mappings for Sentinel tables
