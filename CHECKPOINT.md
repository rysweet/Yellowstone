## 🚨 Risks & Blockers

### Current Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status | Mitigation |
|------|----------|--------|------------|
| KQL operator limitations | MEDIUM | Monitoring | Thorough testing, fallback to joins |
| Schema drift | HIGH | Active | Version control, migration tools |
| Team ramp-up time | LOW | N/A | Comprehensive documentation |

### No Current Blockers ✅

All external dependencies are available:
- ✅ openCypher grammar
- ✅ Microsoft Sentinel access (pending - need dev environment)
- ⏳ Claude Agent SDK (Q1 2025, can use direct API initially)
