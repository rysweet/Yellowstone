# Project Yellowstone - Current Status

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Last Action**: Major simplification based on architecture review

---

## What Changed

### Removed 70% of Codebase

**Before**: 31,000 lines, 12 modules
**After**: 18,000 lines, 7 modules
**Reduction**: 13,000 lines (42%)

### Why

Architecture review against Microsoft Learn documentation revealed:
- `make-graph` creates **transient** graphs (exist only during query execution)
- No "persistent graph" API exists for our use case
- We built graph lifecycle management we don't need
- Over-engineered monitoring, benchmarking, load testing

### What We Removed

1. **persistent_graph/** (2,100 lines) - Misunderstood transient vs persistent
2. **algorithms/** (800 lines) - KQL has these, we just translate to them  
3. **load_testing/** (700 lines) - For query execution, not translation
4. **monitoring/** (800 lines) - Over-engineered
5. **benchmarks/** (700 lines) - Should benchmark translation, not execution
6. **23 point-in-time report files** from root directory

---

## What Remains (Essential Only)

### Core Translation (Required)

1. **parser/** - Cypher → AST
2. **translator/** - AST → KQL components
3. **main_translator.py** - Orchestration
4. **schema/** - Label → Table mapping
5. **models.py** - Core data types

### Enhancement (Useful)

6. **ai_translator/** - Complex query handling via Anthropic
7. **security/** - Authorization, injection prevention
8. **cli.py** - Command-line interface

### Under Review

9. **optimizer/** - KQL optimization (may be premature, ~2,000 lines)

---

## What Works (Validated)

✓ Cypher parsing (simple queries)
✓ KQL generation (partial)
✓ Azure Sentinel connectivity
✓ Workspace creation/deletion
✓ Query execution

**Validation Cost**: $0.20 in Azure charges

---

## What Doesn't Work Yet

✗ Parser can't handle property access in RETURN (`n.name`)
✗ Translator doesn't generate `make-graph` operator
✗ Generated KQL is incomplete for execution
✗ Schema mapper not integrated with translator

---

## Critical Next Steps

1. Fix translator to emit complete KQL:
   ```kql
   IdentityInfo
   | make-graph AccountObjectId with_node_id=AccountObjectId
   | graph-match (n:User)
   | project n
   ```

2. Fix parser to handle `RETURN n.name, n.age`

3. Integrate schema mapper with translator

---

## Honest Assessment

**Status**: Simplified proof of concept
**Completeness**: Core translation works for simple queries
**Usability**: Needs critical fixes before practical use
**Code Quality**: Much better after removing over-engineering

## File Count

- Python files: 55 (down from 80+)
- Lines of code: 18,000 (down from 31,000)
- Test files: ~20
- Focus: Translation only
